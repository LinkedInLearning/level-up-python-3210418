Want to test your Python skills? These concise challenges let you stretch your brain and test your talents. Instructor Barron Stone shares over a dozen Python challenges, as well as his own solutions to each problem—the majority of which are less than two dozen lines of code. The challenges include finding prime factors, sorting strings, scheduling a function, solving a sudoku, and more. You can tackle each problem using the tools in the Python standard library, or opt for the library of your choice. And since each challenge is self-contained, you can complete the course in any order—and at your own pace. Tune in to get the hands-on practice you need to level up your skills.<br><br>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. <br><br>Each installment of the <em>Level Up</em> series offers at least 15 bite-sized opportunities to practice programming at various levels of difficulty, so you can challenge yourself and reinforce what you’ve learned. Check out the [Using GitHub Codespaces with this course][gcs-video-url] video to learn how to get a codespace up and running.
