# Python Code Challenge #3: Sort a String

Your goal is to implement a function, `sort_words()`, that takes a string containing one or more words separated by spaces as the input argument and returns a string containing those words sorted alphabetically.

## Example Test Output
```console
$ sort_words('banana ORANGE apple')
'apple banana ORANGE'
```
